        <p>Micromouse is a world famous robotics competition where a small robot has to search, solve and speedrun a 16x16 maze. I joined a team with my two good friends Ricardo Alcaraz and Roswell Tiongco to attempt to build CSULB's best mouse yet.</p>

          <p>Above you can see a short video of our first robot in action.</p>
          <p> We wanted to create a very simple, easy to develop robot for our first attempt without worrying too much about speed. This is why we decided to use stepper motors, an arduino teensy and ultrasonic sensors. In hindsight, these were poor hardware choices but A LOT was learned in the process of developing this cute little tractor. </p>
          <p>The main issue with the hardware is that the only input to the control system is the ultrasonic sensor readings. The ultrasonic measurements are too low resolution and lack the stability to base a reliable  control system on. As a result, the robot only makes the end of the maze if we're lucky enough that it doesn't hit any walls.</p>

            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>When I took over the SophEE program in 2017, I decided to completely revamp the program in order to be more relevant to skills needed to conduct one's own projects. The main aspect being designing a system and its printed circuit board (PCB) from start to finish.</p>
            <p>Day 1 consists of some introductions, ice breaking and deriving a concept of operations (ConOps). The next meeting, participants jump straight into creating a schematic in EAGLE and eventually lay out their PCB and get to see it manufactured and used in their final robot.</p>
            <p>Throughout the process, they are mentored by myself and other IEEE officers and short, casual lectures are often featured on topics such as motor control, power system design, MOSFETs and more.</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> The documents here are from <b>2017</b>, so somewhat out of date, and I have learned a lot more about schematic layout and PCB design since. There are plenty of errors, but I am leaving it up as it is still a good resource for future IEEE student officers.

          <h1>Flood Fill Pathfinding Algorithm</h1>
          <p>A powerful method of maze solving used for our <a href="/Micromouse/">Micromouse</a> robot.</p>
          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>The maze is divided into cells, and the shortest distance from each cell to the goal is calculated. Initially, it is assumed there are no walls in the maze.</p>
          <p>Then, as the mouse tries to reach the goal by moving to the neighboring cell with the lowest distance, the distances are updated every time a wall is discovered. </p>
          <p>This is repeated, and so the mouse is able to map out the maze and the respective distances to the goal of each cell.</p>
          <p>Upon returning to the start, it is simply a matter of connecting the shortest distances to derive a path that leads straight to the goal.</p>

          <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
          <p>
            <pre>
create two dimensional array 'distance'
create two dimensional array 'walls'

position = bottom left coordinate of maze

for all elements in walls
    element = empty

for all elements in distance
    element = shortest distance to goal

while position != goal
    if a new wall is discovered
        push current coordinate to stack
        for all accessible neighboring cells
            push neighboring cell coordinates to stack

        while !stack.isEmpty
            coordinate = pop from stack

            if distance != lowest distance of neighbors + 1
                distance = lowest distance of neighbors + 1

                for all accessible neighboring cells
                    push neighboring cell coordinates to stack
    move to neighbor with lowest distance
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>A stack approach like this is essential, since using recursion will fill up memory much faster on our microcontroller. With a solid understanding of the algorithm and the functions that were going to be needed, it was time to move on to the implementation.</p>

          <h2>C++ Implementation</h2>
          <p>Since the architecture we are using for our mouse is mostly supported by C++ compilers, this was the obvious language to use.</p>
          <p>The full code can be viewed on our project's <a href="https://github.com/ricardoalcaraz/TheJerrys">Github</a> page and is free for use.</p>
          <p>In order to easily test the algorithm and mouse functions, the code includes a DebugTools class. The printMaze function, for example, prints an ASCII maze including distance values and walls.</p>
          <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="../images/printmaze2.png" style="padding-right:10px">
          <p>Besides the outer edge walls, each wall is displayed twice. This is intended, since walls are also stored in memory twice (one from each neighboring cell).</p>
          <p>This function was extremely useful for debugging, and will also be used during live testing of the mouse, as it has capabilities for bluetooth serial communication.</p>

              <p>I ended up using T connectors for the battery connection and color-coded banana-plugs (EC2) for the sensors as I found them to be robust enough for the application but also not too difficult to disconnect that the users will pull on the wires too hard and damage components down the line. JST connectors, for example, did not work well here.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, I decided to try my hand at a Hackathon with my Micromouse teammates. We drove to Santa Barbara for one of the largest hackathons in the country and ended up winning "Best IoT Hack" for our trash can data collection device. I wrote a full summary on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/trash-scan"> the event's Devpost page.</a></p>
          <h1>Engineers for a Sustainable World</h1>
          <p>As a member of Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW), I worked on a solar kiosk that won grants from IBM Students for a Smarter Planet, 1st place in the CSULB Green Generation Mixer Project Showcase and a feature in the CSULB sustainability magazine.</p>
          <p>For this year's Green Generation Mixer, I designed the electronics for an automated aquaponics system which gathered a lot of attention but lost to fellow club member Anesia Canty's amazing <a href="https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/news/?p=12389"> water filtration system</a></p>
          <p>The main issue the team already working on the aquaponics project ran into had to do with timing the system to perform tasks at long intervals, such as turning off the lights after 3 hour intervals. Having some experience in IoT projects however, I knew this wasn't a very difficult problem. We ended up implementing a real-time clock module to wake up the microcontroller at certain intervals. For the Green Generation Mixer, we added a button to simply trigger every subroutine in turn to demonstrate the pumps, lights and sensors.</p>
