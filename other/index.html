          <h1>Chem-E-Car</h1>
          <p>Chem-E-Car is a student competition to build a chemical powered car to transport a certain payload a certain distance (weight and distance are only revealed an hour before the competition). I was asked by a group of Chemical Engineering majors at CSULB to design the electronics for their Aluminium-air battery powered car.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Although the system for this car was quite simple (turn a servo, read a sensor, start stop a motor), the difficulty came from making the system robust and easy to use for non-electrical engineers in a stressful situation where the sensors and batteries have to be disconnected, reconnected and the electronics are around corrosive chemicals.</p>
          <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
              <p>I ended up using T connectors for the battery connection and color-coded banana-plugs (EC2) for the sensors as I found them to be robust enough for the application but also not too difficult to disconnect that the users will pull on the wires too hard and damage components down the line. JST connectors, for example, did not work well here.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, I decided to try my hand at a Hackathon with my Micromouse teammates. We drove to Santa Barbara for one of the largest hackathons in the country and ended up winning "Best IoT Hack" for our Trash can data collection device. I wrote a full summary on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/trash-scan"> the event's Devpost page.</a></p>
          <h1>Engineers for a Sustainable World</h1>
          <p>As a member of Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW), I worked on a solar kiosk that won grants from IBM Students for a Smarter Planet, 1st place in the CSULB Green Generation Mixer Project Showcase and a feature in the CSULB sustainability magazine.</p>
          <p>For this year's Green Generation Mixer, I designed the electronics for an automated aquaponics system which gathered a lot of attention but lost to fellow club member Anesia Canty's amazing <a href="https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/news/?p=12389"> water filtration system</a>.

            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>Although I don't want to become a front end web developer, I have created some websites for the student organizations I was a part of, as well as the website you're seeing right now. The IEEE and ESW websites were created from scratch and this website was created using <a href="https://purecss.io/">Pure.css css modules</a> </p>
